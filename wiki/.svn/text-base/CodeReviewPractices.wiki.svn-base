#summary Instructions for Code Review process

= Introduction =

So, you wanna patch some of this beautiful code do ya? Then get ready for code reviews, svn branching and svn merging!

= Setting Up A Branch =

First things first, create your branch and commit it:

{{{
termie@pito:~/p/oauth % svn cp code/php branches/termie-somebranch                     
A         branches/termie-somebranch

termie@pito:~/p/oauth % svn commit branches/termie-somebranch -m "branching to get some patches reviewed"       
Adding         branches/termie--somebranch

Committed revision 877.
}}}

= Getting It Reviewed =

Work work work, hopefully this doesn't take too long so you don't get out of date from trunk.

Go to and make a new review issue, http://code.google.com/p/oauth/issues/entry?show=review

You'll get comments on your changes.

= Merging In SVN Sucks =

But somebody's got to do it. If nothing has changed in trunk since you started your branch it isn't too tricky. The basic command looks like this:

{{{
termie@pito:~/p/oauth % svn merge code/php@HEAD branches/termie-somebranch@HEAD code/php
U    branches/termie-somebranch/tests/OAuthRequestTest.php
U    branches/termie-somebranch/OAuth.php
}}}

This will take the changes that `branches/termie-somebranch` has made compared to `code/php` and then apply them to your checked out code at `code/php`.

The first two arguments can be repo urls but the last one always has to be a working copy path.
