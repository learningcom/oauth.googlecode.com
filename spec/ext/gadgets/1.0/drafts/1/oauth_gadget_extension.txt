                    OAuth Gadgets Extension Draft 1


Abstract

   OAuth Core 1.0 defines a protocol for delegating user access to
   Consumer applications without sharing the user's private credentials.
   Sometimes, the consumer application plays host to a large number of
   smaller applications ("gadgets").  In that case, the consumer
   application may make OAuth requests on behalf of one of its hosted
   gadgets.

   This draft specifies a mechanism in which a consumer can express on
   behalf of which of its hosted gadgets OAuth requests are being made
   to a service provider.

2.  Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  Domain
   name examples use [RFC2606].

   Unless otherwise noted, this specification is written as a direct
   continuation of [OAuth Core 1.0], inheriting the definitions and
   guidelines set by it.

3.  Definitions

   Consumer Identity: The Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, and any other
      information used to establish an identity for the Consumer such as
      public key.

   Gadget Server: An OAuth consumer, with its own consumer identity,
      that hosts a number of smaller applications ("gadgets"), which
      don't have their own consumer identity.

   Gadget: An application hosted by a gadget server wishing to make
      OAuth requests to a service provider.  Every gadget is located at
      a specific URL, from which the gadget server obtains the gadget.
      A gadget doesn't have its own consumer identity.  Instead, the
      gadget server's consumer identity will be used when making the
      OAuth requests on behalf of the gadget.

4.  The Gadgets Extension Parameter

   This extension defines one additional OAuth parameter to be used in
   OAuth requests originating from an OAuth consumer:

   xoauth_app_url: The URL of the gadget originating the OAuth request.

   A consumer MUST include the "xoauth_app_url" parameter in requests to
   the the Request Token URL and Access Token URL at the Service
   Provider (see Sections 6.1.1 and 6.3.1 of [OAuth Core 1.0]).  The
   consumer MUST also include the "xoauth_app_url" parameter when
   accessing protected resources (see Section 7 of [OAuth Core 1.0]).
