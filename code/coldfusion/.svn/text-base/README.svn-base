Installation
------------------------------------------------
1.	Create an empty database and ColdFusion DSN called "oauth"

2.	If you are using a MSSQL database, you don't have to modify the variables in the file "database/create_tables.cfm".
	Otherwise you have to modify the variable "sDbsys" for the database platform in use.

3.	Execute "database/create_tables.cfm"

4.	Configure the base URL and endpoint links in the file "examples/common.cfm"

5.	Copy the folder oauth into your web folder or set a mapping called oauth for this folder

6.	Create a consumer in "examples/admin_consumers.cfm" with the values consumer key = CONSUMER_KEY and consumer secret = CONSUMER_SECRET

7.  Now you can browse through the example files (examples/index.cfm) and test the endpoints and token generation
